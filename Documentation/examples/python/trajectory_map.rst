.. _Trajectory_Map_Example:

===========================================
Rendering Trajectories from Points on a Map
===========================================

.. important:: `Cartopy <https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/>`_ 0.18.0
   is required to successfully render maps and pass our internal tests.

.. note:: The images generated from the below commands will have a
   large border around the rendered map, this is expected and correct.

Terrestrial Trajectory Map
--------------------------

As soon as we add timestamps to our (longitude, latitude) points we
can sensibly assemble sequences of points into trajectories.
Trajectories lend themselves to being plotted as lines on a map.
We have provided a sample data set of fictitious trajectories between
many of the world's busiest airports for you to use. All references to
``TRACKTABLE`` in the commands below is refering to the
directory where you unpacked/installed Tracktable.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m "tracktable.examples.trajectory_map_from_points" \
       TRACKTABLE/examples/data/SampleTrajectories.csv \
       TrajectoryMapExample1.png

.. image:: /images/TrajectoryMapExample1.png
   :scale: 50%

The trajectories are colored according to the `progress` feature that
ranges from 0 at the beginning of a trajectory to 1 at its end.
However, the thin lines make them difficult to see with this
resolution and color map. Let's make the lines for the trajectories
wider and change the color map.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m "tracktable.examples.trajectory_map_from_points" \
       --trajectory-linewidth 2 \
       --trajectory-colormap winter \
       TRACKTABLE/examples/data/SampleTrajectories.csv \
       TrajectoryMapExample2.png

   :scale: 50%

Just for the sake of argument, let's zoom in on the eastern US. We
don't have a predefined map for that but we can come up with a
bounding box. We want the region from (-90, 24) to (-60, 50). Recall
that in our longitude-first convention that's (90W, 24N) to (60W,
50N). While we're at it, let's also draw and label every city with a
population over half a million people.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m "tracktable.examples.trajectory_map_from_points" \
       --trajectory-linewidth 2 \
       --trajectory-colormap winter \
       --map custom \
       --map-bbox -90 24 -60 50 \
       --draw-cities-larger-than 500000 \
       TRACKTABLE/examples/data/SampleTrajectories.csv \
       TrajectoryMapExample3.png

.. image:: /images/TrajectoryMapExample3.png
   :scale: 50%

Last and not least, let's highlight the borders of the US states and
Canadian provinces in bright green lines 2 points wide. We'll also
decrease the trajectory width so that the city labels aren't so
overwhelmed. Don't forget the backslash (``\``) in front of ``--state-color`` value.

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m "tracktable.examples.trajectory_map_from_points" \
       --state-color \#80FF80 \
       --state-linewidth 2 \
       --trajectory-linewidth 1 \
       --trajectory-colormap winter \
       --map custom \
       --map-bbox -90 24 -60 50 \
       --draw-cities-larger-than 500000 \
       TRACKTABLE/examples/data/SampleTrajectories.csv \
       TrajectoryMapExample4.png

.. image:: /images/TrajectoryMapExample4.png
   :scale: 50%

This result is not going to win any beauty contests but you've now
seen a few more options available to you. Tracktable allows you to
change the presence, appearance and style of boundaries for
continents, countries and states (US/Canada only at present). You can
filter and draw city locations by population (given some minimum
threshold) or by ranking. You can change the line style, appearance
and color map for the rendered trajectories. All of this is explained
in the :ref:`Tracktable_Python_User_Guide` and the
:ref:`API Reference Documentation <tracktable_api_label>`.

Cartesian Trajectory Map
------------------------

Since the addition of point domains we can use the
same rendering code that draws on maps of the world to draw data in
flat 2D Cartesian space. You need to specify ``--domain cartesian2d``
and ``--map-bbox x y X Y``. All references to
``TRACKTABLE`` in the command below is refering to the
directory where you unpacked/installed Tracktable.

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m "tracktable.examples.trajectory_map_from_points" \
         --map-bbox -100 -100 100 100 \
         --domain cartesian2d \
