****************************
Using Tracktable With Python
****************************

For this first release we're going to focus on getting point data into
Tracktable and rendered out as a heatmap, trajectory map or movie
using the Python interface.  We will add more sections to this user
guide as we add capability to the toolkit.

.. _userguide-python-basics:

Basic Classes

-------
Domains
-------

.. todo:: Write an explanatory page for the Python domain module.

Tracktable operates on points, timestamps and trajectories.  Since
points and trajectories are meaningless without a coordinate system,
we instantiate points and trajectories from a *domain*.  Each domain
provides several different data types and a standard set of units.  By
design, it is difficult to mix points and trajectories from different
domains.  While we cannot prevent you entirely from mixing up (for
example) kilometers and miles when computing distances, we can at
least try to make it difficult.

Tracktable 1.3 includes the following domains:

.. csv-table:: Available Point Domains
   :header: "C++ Namespace", "Python Module", "Description"
   :widths: 30, 30, 30

   "tracktable::domain::terrestrial", "tracktable.domain.terrestrial", "Points in longitude/latitude space"
   "tracktable::domain::cartesian2d", "tracktable.domain.cartesian2d", "Points in flat 2D space"
   "tracktable::doamin::cartesian3d", "tracktable.domain.cartesian3d", "Points in flat 3D space"

Each domain defines several data types:

.. csv-table:: Domain Data Types
   :header: "C++ Class", "Python Class", "Description"
   :widths: 10, 10, 40

   "base_point_type", "BasePoint", "Bare point - just coordinates."
   "trajectory_point_type", "TrajectoryPoint", "Point with coordinates, object ID, timestamp and used-defined properties."
   "linestring_type", "LineString", "Vector of un-decorated points (base points)."
   "trajectory_type", "Trajectory", "Vector of trajectory points.  Trajectories have their own user-defined properties."
   "base_point_reader_type", "BasePointReader", "Read BasePoints from a delimited text file."
   "trajectory_point_reader_type", "TrajectoryPointReader", "Read TrajectoryPoints from a delimited text file."
   "box_type", "Box", "Axis-aligned bounding box."


We provide rendering support for the terrestrial and 2D Cartesian
domains via Matplotlib and Basemap.  Rendering support for 3D points
and trajectories is still an open issue.  Given the limited support
for 3D data in Matplotlib we may delegate this job to another library.
Exactly which library we might choose is open for discussion.

NOTE: In this guide we will assume you are working with
TrajectoryPoint data rather than BasePoint data and that you are in
the terrestrial domain.


.. _userguide-python-timestamp:

---------
Timestamp
---------


There is a single timestamp class that is common across all point
domains.  In C++ this is ``tracktable::Timestamp``, a thinly disguised
``boost::posix_time::ptime``.  In Python this is a timezone-aware
:py:class:`datetime.datetime`.  As is the case elsewhere in
Tracktable, we convert automatically between the two data types when
Python code calls C++ and vice versa.

The :py:class:`tracktable.core.Timestamp <tracktable.core.timestamp.Timestamp>` class contains several
convenience methods for manipulating timestamps.  A full list is in
the reference documentation.  We use the following ones most frequently.

* :py:func:`Timestamp.from_any <tracktable.core.timestamp.Timestamp.from_any>`: Try to convert whatever argument we
  supply into a timestamp.  The input can be a :py:class:`dict`, a
  :py:class:`datetime <datetime.datetime>`, a string in the format
  ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`` or ``YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS+ZZ`` (for a time
  zone offset from UTC).

* :py:func:`Timestamp.to_string <tracktable.core.timestamp.Timestamp.to_string>`: Convert a timestamp into its string
  representation.  By default this will produce a string like
  ``2014-08-28 13:23:45``.  Optional arguments to the function will
  allow us to change the output format and include a timezone
  indicator.

.. todo: Add documentation for C++ methods for manipulating timestamps

.. _userguide-python-base-point:

-----------
Base Points
-----------

Within a domain, Tracktable uses the ``BasePoint`` class to store a bare set of coordinates.
These behave like vectors or sequences in that we use square brackets to set and get coordinates.
Access a point's coordinates as if the point were an array using
``[]``.  In Python::

    from tracktable.domain.terrestrial import BasePoint

    my_point = BasePoint()
    my_point[0] = my_longitude
    my_point[1] = my_latitude

    longitude = my_point[0]
    latitude = my_point[1]

Longitude is always coordinate 0 and latitude is always coordinate 1.
We choose this ordering for consistency with the 2D Cartesian domain
where the X coordinate is always at position 0 and the Y coordinate is
at position 1.

.. _userguide-python-trajectory-point:

-----------------
Trajectory Points
-----------------

The things that make a point part of a trajectory are: (1) its
coordinates, already covered by BasePoint; (2) an identifier for the
moving object; (3) a timestamp recording when the object was
observed. These are the main differences between BasePoint and TrajectoryPoint.

In Python::

   from tracktable.domain.terrestrial import TrajectoryPoint
   from tracktable.core import Timestamp

   my_point = TrajectoryPoint()
   longitude = 50
   latitude = 40
   my_point[0] = longitude
   my_point[1] = latitude

   my_point.object_id = 'FlightId'
   my_point.timestamp = Timestamp.from_any('2014-04-05 13:25:00')

In C++::

   my_point = tracktable::domain::terrestrial::trajectory_point

   float longitude = 50, latitude = 40;
   my_point[0] = longitude;
   my_point[1] = latitude;

   my_point.set_object_id("FlightId");
   my_point.set_timestamp(tracktable::time_from_string("2014-04-05 13:25:00");

You may want to associate other data with a point as well.  For example::

    my_point.properties['altitude'] = 13400
    my_point.properties['origin'] = 'ORD'
    my_point.properties['destination'] = 'LAX'
    my_point.properties['departure_time'] = Timestamp.from_any('2015-02-01 18:00:00')

For the most part you can treat the properties array like a Python
dict.  However, it can only hold values that are of numeric, string or
Timestamp type.

Note that the timestamp and object ID properties are specific to trajectory points.

--------------------
Operations On Points
--------------------

The module :py:mod:`tracktable.core.geomath` has most of the
operations we want to perform on two or more points.  Here are a few
common ones.  These work with both BasePoint and TrajectoryPoint
unless otherwise noted.

* ``distance(A, B)``: Compute distance between A and B
* ``bearing(origin, destination)``: Compute the bearing from the origin to the destination
* ``speed_between(here, there)``: Compute speed between two TrajectoryPoints
* ``signed_turn_angle(A, B, C)``: Angle between vectors AB and BC
* ``unsigned_turn_angle(A, B, C)``: Absolute value of angle between vectors AB and BC

.. _userguide-python-trajectories:

------------
Trajectories
------------

Just as each domain has ``BasePoint`` and ``TrajectoryPoint`` classes,
we include ``LineString`` and ``Trajectory`` for ordered sequences of
points.

``LineString`` is analogous to ``BasePoint`` in that it has no
decoration at all.  It is just a sequence of points.  ``Trajectory``
has its own ID (``trajectory_id``) as well as its own properties
array.

As with point classes above, each domain in Tracktable defines a
trajectory class.  A trajectory is just a vector of points with a few
extra properties attached.  In C++, a trajectory behaves just like a
``std::vector`` and can be used with the C++ Standard Library as such.
In Python, a trajectory is an iterable just like any other sequence.


Here are examples of creating a trajectory in each language.


C++::

  // Assume this array has been populated already
  trajectory_point_type my_points[100];


  // Initialize with iterators
  trajectory_type my_trajectory(my_points, my_points+100);

  trajectory_type my_trajectory2;
  for (int i = 0; i < 100; ++i) {
     my_trajectory2.push_back(my_points[i]);
  }

Python::

  # Populate a trajectory from scratch
  from tracktable.domain.terrestrial import Trajectory

  traj = Trajectory()
  for point in mypoints:
      traj.append(mypoint)

  # Alternate approach in case you already have points in a list:
  traj = Trajectory.from_position_list(my_point_list)


Tracktable expects that all points in a given trajectory will have the
same object ID.  Timestamps must not decrease from one point to the
next.



There are several free functions defined on trajectories that do
useful things.  We expect that the following will be used most often:


* ``point_at_time(trajectory: Trajectory, when: Timestamp)``: Given a
  timestamp, interpolate between points on the trajectory to find the
  point at exactly the specified time.  Timestamps before the
  beginning or after the end of the trajectory will return the start
  and end points, respectively.  Tracktable will try to interpolate
  all properties that are defined on the trajectory points.

* ``subset_in_window(trajectory: Trajectory, start, end: Timestamp)``:
  Given a start and end timestamp, extract the subset of the
  trajectory between those two times.  The start and end points will
  be at exactly the start and end times you specify.  These will be
  interpolated if there are no points in the trajectory at precisely
  the right time.  Points in between the start and end times will be
  copied from the trajectory without modification.

* ``recompute_speed``, ``recompute_heading``: Compute new values for
  the ``speed`` and ``heading`` numeric properties at each point given
  the position and timestamp attributes.  These are convenient if our
  original data set lacks speed/heading information or if the original
  values are corrupt.

.. todo: Make sure recompute_speed and recompute_heading are there where appropriate

.. _userguide-input:

=====
Input
=====

There are three ways to get point data into Tracktable in version
1.2.4.  We can instantiate and populate TrajectoryPoint objects by
hand, load points from a delimited text file, or create them
algorithmically.

If we choose to create points algorithmically we will need to supply
(at a minimum) coordinates, a timestamp and an ID.

.. todo: Example of creating points algorithmically

.. _loading-points:

----------------------------------
Loading Points from Delimited Text
----------------------------------

Tracktable has a flexible point reader for delimited text files.  The
bare class is the templated PointReader in the IO directory.  Each
point domain provides two versions of it, one for loading base points
(coordinates only) and one for loading trajectory points.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Python Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   from tracktable.domain.terrestrial import TrajectoryPointReader

        with open('point_data.csv', 'rb') as infile:
            reader = TrajectoryPointReader()
	    reader.input = infile
	    reader.delimiter = ','

	    # Columns 0 and 1 are the object ID and timestamp
	    reader.object_id_column = 0
	    reader.timestamp_column = 1

	    # Columns 2 and 3 are the longitude and
	    # latitude (coordinates 0 and 1)
	    reader.coordinates[0] = 2
	    reader.coordinates[1] = 3

	    # Column 4 is the altitude
	    reader.set_real_field_column("altitude", 4)

	    for point in reader:
                 # Do whatever you want with the points here

.. _point-sources:

Point Sources
-------------

.. todo: This section is out of date

There are algorithmic point generators in the
``tracktable.source.path_point_source`` module that are suitable for
trajectory-building.  The ones most likely to be useful are
:py:class:`GreatCircleTrajectoryPointSource <tracktable.source.path_point_source.GreatCircleTrajectoryPointSource>`
and :py:class:`LinearTrajectoryPointSource <tracktable.source.path_point_source.LinearTrajectoryPointSource>`.
Give them start and end points, start and end times, a number of
points to generate and an object ID and you should be ready to go.

.. todo: Code example

.. _trajectory-assembly:

-----------------------------------
Assembling Points into Trajectories
-----------------------------------

.. todo: This section is out of date

Creating trajectories from a set of points is simple conceptually but
logistically annoying when we write the code ourselves.  The overall
idea is as follows:

1. Group points together by object ID and increasing timestamp.

2. For each object ID, connect one point to the next to form
   trajectories.

3. Break the sequence to create a new trajectory whenever it doesn't
   make sense to connect two neighboring points.

This is common enough that Tracktable includes a filter
(:py:class:`tracktable.source.trajectory.AssembleTrajectoryFromPoints`)
to perform the assembly starting from a Python iterable of points
sorted by non-decreasing timestamp.  We can specify two parameters to
control part 3 (when to start a new trajectory):

* ``separation_time``: A :py:class:`datetime.timedelta` specifying the
  longest permissible gap between points in the same trajectory.  Any
  gap longer than this will start a new trajectory.

* ``separation_distance``: Maximum permissible distance (in
  kilometers) between two points in the same trajectory.  Any gap
  longer than this will start a new trajectory.

We can also specify a ``minimum_length``.  Trajectories with fewer than
this many points will be silently discarded.

^^^^^^^
Example
^^^^^^^
::

  trajectory_builder = AssembleTrajectoryFromPoints()
	trajectory_builder.input = point_reader

	trajectory_builder.separation_time = datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)
	trajectory_builder.separation_distance = 100
	trajectory_builder.minimum_length = 10

	for traj in trajectory_builder.trajectories():
	     # process trajectories here

-----------
Annotations
-----------

Once we have points or trajectories in memory we may want to
annotate them with derived quantities for analysis or rendering.  For
example, we might want to color an airplane's trajectory using its
climb rate to indicate takeoff, landing, ascent and descent.  we
might want to use acceleration, deceleration and rates of turning to
help classify moving objects.

The module ``tracktable.feature.annotations`` contains functions to do
this.  Every feature defined in that package has two functions
associated with it: a *calculator* and an *accessor*.  The calculator
computes the values for a feature and stores them in the trajectory.
The accessor takes an already-annotated trajectory and returns a
1-dimensional array containing the values of the already-computed
feature.  This allows us to attach as many annotations to a
trajectory as we like and then select which one to use (and how) at
render time.

.. todo:: Code example for annotations

--------
Analysis
--------
Once the points or trajectories have been generated and annotated we may need
to perform analysis to determine information about the points or trajectories
such as clustering, distance geometry or nearest neighbors.

The ``tracktable.analysis`` module contains the submodules necessary to
to perform these types of analyses on points or trajectories. The
``tracktable.analysis.dbscan`` submodule will perform the density-based spatial
clustering of applications with noise analysis to determine the clustering of the
feature vector points. The ``tracktable.analysis.distance_geometry`` submodule will
compute the multilevel distance geometry for a trajectory based on either ``length``
or ``time``. The ``tracktable.analysis.rtree`` submodule will generate an rtree that
will compute the nearest neighbors based on provided points within a clustering box.

=========
Rendering
=========

Now we come to the fun part: making images and movies from data.

Tracktable 1.2.4 supports three kinds of visualization: a heatmap (2D
histogram), a trajectory map (lines/curves drawn on the map) and a
trajectory movie.  We render heatmaps directly from points.
Trajectory maps and movies require assembled trajectories.

In all cases we render points into a 2D projection.  Here in the
user's guide we will discuss rendering onto a map projection.  The
procedure for rendering points in Cartesian space is very similar and
will be documented Real Soon Now.

We use the `Cartopy <http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy>`_ toolkit for the
map projection and `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_ for the
actual rendering.

----------------
Setting Up a Map
----------------

The easiest way to create and decorate a map is with the
:py:func:`tracktable.render.mapmaker.mapmaker` function.  It can
create maps of common (named) areas of the world, regions surrounding
airports, and user-specified regions.  Here's an example that will
create a map of Australia with coastlines and longitude/latitude
graticules rendered every 2 degrees. ::

    from tracktable.render.mapmaker import mapmaker
    from matplotlib import pyplot

    f = pyplot.figure(size=(8, 6), dpi=100)

    (mymap, initial_artists) = mapmaker('australia',
                                        draw_coastlines=True,
					draw_countries=False,
					draw_states=False,
					draw_lonlat=True,
					lonlat_spacing=2,
					lonlat_linewidth=0.5)

We always return two values from Mapmaker.  The first is the
:py:class:`mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap` instance that will convert
points between world coordinates (longitude/latitude) and map
coordinates.  The second is a list of Matplotlib :py:class:``artists
<matplotlib.artist.Artist>`` that define all the decorations added to
the map.

There are several predefined map areas.  Their names can be retrieved
by calling :py:func:``tracktable.render.maps.available_maps()``.  If you
would like to have a region included please send us its name and
longitude/latitude bounding box.  We will add it to the next release.


.. figure:: images/Australia.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Map of Australia

This map of Australia was generated by passing the map name
``australia`` to Mapmaker.

This next example will render a 200x200 km area around Boston's Logan
Airport (BOS).  Coastlines will be drawn with an extra-thick
(2-point-wide) red line.  US state borders will be drawn in blue.
Land will be filled in using solid white.  We use high-resolution
borders since we're zoomed in fairly far.::


    from tracktable.render.mapmaker import mapmaker
    from matplotlib import pyplot

    f = pyplot.figure(size=(8, 6), dpi=100)
    (mymap, initial_artists) = mapmaker('airport:BOS',
                                        border_resolution='h',
                                        draw_coastlines=True,
					draw_states=True,
                                        land_color='white',
                                        coastline_color='red',
                                        coastline_linewidth=2,
                                        country_color='blue')

.. figure:: images/Boston.png
   :scale: 50%

This map of the area around Boston's Logan Airport was generated by
passing the map name ``airport:BOS`` to Mapmaker.

.. note:: The underlying :py:func:``maps.map_for_airport()
          <tracktable.render.maps.map_for_airport>`` function allows
          you to change the size of the displayed area from 200x200 km
          to anything you want.  We will expose this parameter via
          Mapmaker in a future release.  In the meantime, if you need
          that level of control we suggest using ``map_name =
          'custom'`` and ``map_bbox`` to get the area you need.

If we want a map that does not correspond to any of the predefined
ones then we can use the 'custom' map type.  This example will create
a map of Japan and the Korean Peninsula with all cities labeled whose population is larger than 2 million. ::

    from tracktable.render.mapmaker import mapmaker
    from matplotlib import pyplot

    f = pyplot.figure(size=(8, 6), dpi=100)

    # Bounding box is [ longitude_min, latitude_min,
    #                   longitude_max, latitude_max ]
    (mymap, initial_artists) = mapmaker(
               'custom',
               map_bbox = [ 123.5, 148, 23.5, 48 ],
               draw_cities_larger_than=2000000
          )

.. figure:: images/JapanKorea.png
   :scale: 50%
   :alt: Map of Japan and Korea

   This map was generated by passing the map name ``custom`` and a
   longitude/latitude bounding box to Mapmaker.


.. note:: To define a map area that crosses the discontinuity at
          longitude +/- 180 degrees, use coordinates that wrap around
          beyond 180.  The bounding boxes (-200, 0, -160, 40) and
          (160, 0, 200, 40) both define a region that extends from 0
          to 40 degrees latitude and 20 degrees to either side of 180
          degrees longitude.

.. todo:: We haven't described how to set up a map projection for the
          Cartesian domain.

----------------------
Rendering Onto the Map
----------------------

Since Tracktable uses `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`_ as its
underlying renderer you can immediately render almost anything you
want on top of a map.  Remember, however, that Matplotlib does not
know about the map projection.  In order to draw things that will be
properly registered onto the map you need to use the
:py:class:`Basemap <mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap>` instance that we
got earlier when we set up our map using Mapmaker.  By calling the map
instance as if it were a function you can convert coordinates from
world space (longitude/latitude) to axis space (arbitrary coordinates
established by Matplotlib).

There are many ways to draw things like contours, points, curves,
glyphs and text directly onto the map.  Please refer to the `example
gallery <http://matplotlib.org/basemap/users/examples.html>`_ for
demonstrations.  Tracktable provides code to render two of the most
common use cases for trajectory data: heatmaps (2D histograms) and
trajectory maps.

.. _userguide-heat-maps:

^^^^^^^^^
Heat Maps
^^^^^^^^^

A *heat map* (`Wikipedia page
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_map>`_) is a two-dimensional
histogram -- that is, a density plot.  We use heat maps to illustrate
the density of points that compose a set of trajectories.  We are
typically looking for areas of high traffic and areas of coverage.

This release of Tracktable supports heat maps rendered on top of
geographic maps using the
:py:class:`tracktable.render.histogram2d.geographic` function.  You
must call it with at least two arguments -- a :py:class:``Basemap
<mpl_toolkits.basemap.Basemap>`` instance and an iterable of points.
Other optional arguments will let you control the histogram bin size,
color map and where on the map the heatmap is rendered.

We include a start-to-finish example of how to load points and render
a heat map in the ``heatmap_from_csv.py`` script in the
``tracktable/examples/`` subdirectory of our Python code.  You can find
this example on the :doc:`/examples/python/heatmap` page.

.. note:: The :py:class:``histogram2d.geographic()
          <tracktable.render.histogram2d.geographic>`` heat map
          generator only traverses its input data once to keep memory
          requirements low.  You can safely use it with point sets too
          large to load into memory at once.

.. _userguide-trajectory-maps:

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Trajectory Maps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *trajectory map* is an ordinary map with one or more trajectories
drawn on it.  We may want to decorate a trajectory with any of the
following:

* Colors defined as a function of some quantity computed for the
  trajectory such as speed, turn rate or altitude
* Variable line widths (such as a trajectory that is broad at its head
  and narrow at its tail)
* A dot of some color and size at the head of the trajectory to mark
  the object's actual position
* A label at the head of the trajectory to display an object ID

All of this is packaged into the function :py:func:`draw_traffic
<tracktable.render.paths.draw_traffic>` in the
:py:mod:`tracktable.render.paths` module.

.. note:: The argument names for that function are slightly
          misleading.  Pay careful attention to the documentation for
          that function.  Specifically, the arguments
          ``trajectory_linewidth_generator`` and
          ``trajectory_scalar_generator`` seem to indicate by their
          names that you must compute the linewidths and scalars at
          render time.  This is fine for single images.  For movies,
          we find it more useful to compute as much as we can before
          rendering and then pass an accessor function in as the
          generator.

Like :ref:`heat maps <userguide-heat-maps>`, trajectory maps have
their own example script ``trajectory_map_from_csv.py`` in the
``tracktable/examples`` directory.  You can find this example on the
:doc:`/examples/python/trajectory_map` page.


-------------
Making Movies
-------------

To a first approximation, making a movie is the same as making a
single image many, many times.  The part that takes some care is
minimizing the number of times we perform expensive operations such as
loading data and configuring/decorating a map.

Our approach looks like this::

     all_data = load_data()
     figure = setup_matplotlib_figure()
     setup_map_projection(figure)
     movie_writer = setup_movie_writer()

     with movie_writer.saving(figure, 'movie_filename.mp4'):
         for frame_num in xrange(num_frames):
             frame_data = render_frame(frame_num, all_data)
             movie_writer.grab_frame()
             cleanup_frame(frame_data)

The setup phase is exactly the same as it would be if we were
rendering a single image.  The conceptual differences are in
``render_frame()``, which must take into account which frame it's
drawing, and ``cleanup_frame()``, which restores the drawing area to
its beginning-of-frame state.  We adopt the convention that
``render_frame()`` shall return a list of all Matplotlib artists that
were added to the figure while rendering the current frame.  That way
we can clean up by removing each artist after the frame has been saved
by a call to ``movie_writer.grab_frame()``.

Although Matplotlib supports several different animation back ends
including live on-screen animation, Mencoder, FFMPEG, ImageMagick,
Tracktable 0.9.0 only supports the FFMPEG back end.  There are two
reasons.  First, FFMPEG is available for nearly all platforms and is
quite capable.  By supporting it before any others we can help as many
users as possible render movies as quickly as possible.  Second,
FFMPEG has a few extra capabilities that make it well suited to
rendering movies in parallel.

Please refer to the files ``example_movie_rendering.py``,
``movie_from_csv.py`` and ``parallel_movie_from_csv.py`` in the
directory ``tracktable/Python/tracktable/examples`` for an
illustration of how to render a movie.  More thorough documentation
will follow soon.

Tracktable's various rendering facilities have a lot of options.
Python makes it easy for us to expose these as command-line options
that can be passed to scripts.  However, that just pushes the problem
out one level: now the user has to remember the values for all of
those options, or else write shell scripts that call Python scripts in
order to keep track of what parameters were used where.

We introduce two facilities to help tame this morass:

1. **Argument Groups**: An argument group is a set of command-line
   arguments that all pertain to a single capability.  For example,
   the argument group for trajectory assembly has entries for the
   maximum separation distance, maximum separation time and minimum
   length as described above in :ref:`trajectory-assembly`.

2. **Response Files**: A response file is a way to package up
   arbitrarily many command-line arguments in a file and pass them to
   a script all at once.  It is independent of which script is being
   run.  Since a response file is just text it is easy to place under
   version control.  We provide a slightly modified version of the
   standard Python :py:mod:`argparse` module that includes support
   for response files containing comments and response files that load
   other response files.

Argument Groups
---------------

The point of an argument group is to save us from having to cut and
paste the same potentially-lengthy list of arguments and their
respective handlers into each new script we write.  When we render a
movie of data over time, for example, we will always need several
pieces of information including resolution, frame rate, and the
duration of our movie.

Since we're human we are guaranteed to forget an argument here, spell
one differently there, and before long we have a dozen scripts that
all take completely different command-line arguments.  Bundling
arguments in an easy-to-reuse fashion makes it easy for us to use the
same ones consistently.

We derive another benefit at the same time.  By abstracting away a set
of arguments into a semi-opaque module, we can add capability to (for
example) the mapmaker without having to change our movie-making
script.  Once the argument group for the mapmaker is updated, any
script that uses the mapmaker's argument group will automatically gain
access to the new capability.

There are three parts to using argument groups.  First they must be
created and registered.  Second, they are applied when we create an
argument parser for a script.  Finally, once command-line arguments
have been parsed, we (as the programmers) can extract values for each
argument group that you used.  All of these functions are in the
:py:mod:`tracktable.script_helpers.argument_groups.utilities` module.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Creating an Argument Group
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We create an argument group first by declaring it with
:py:func:`create_argument_group() <tracktable.script_helpers.utilities.create_argument_group>`
and then populating it with calls to
:py:func:`add_argument() <tracktable.script_helpers.utilities.add_argument>`.  Here is an example from the ``movie_rendering`` group::


    create_argument_group("movie_rendering",
                          title="Movie Parameters",
                          description="Movie-specific parameters such as frame rate, encoder options, title and metadata")

    add_argument("movie_rendering", [ "--duration" ],
                 type=int,
                 default=60,
                 help="How many seconds long the movie should be")

    add_argument("movie_rendering", [ "--fps" ],
                 type=int,
                 default=30,
                 help="Movie frame rate in frames/second")

    add_argument("movie_rendering", [ "--encoder-args" ],
                 default="-c:v mpeg4 -q:v 5",
                 help="Extra args to pass to the encoder (pass in as a single string)")

All of Tracktable's standard argument groups are in files in the
``Python/tracktable/script_helpers/argument_groups`` directory.  Look
at ``__init__.py`` in that directory for an example of how to add one
to the registry.  You can register your own groups anywhere in your
code that you choose.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Applying Argument Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use argument groups by applying their arguments to an
already-instantiated argument parser.  That can be an instance of the
standard :py:class:`argparse.ArgumentParser` or our customized version
:py:class:`tracktable.script_helpers.argparse.ArgumentParser`.  Here
is an example::

    from tracktable.script_helpers import argparse, argument_groups

    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    argument_groups.use_argument_group("delimited_text_point_reader", parser)
    argument_groups.use_argument_group("trajectory_assembly", parser)
    argument_groups.use_argument_group("trajectory_rendering", parser)
    argument_groups.use_argument_group("mapmaker", parser)

We can interleave calls to :py:func:`use_argument_group() <tracktable.script_helpers.argument_groups.utilities.use_argument_group>`
freely with calls to other functions defined on
:py:class:`ArgumentParser <argparse.ArgumentParser>`.
We recommend reading the code for
:py:func:`use_argument_group() <tracktable.script_helpers.argument_groups.utilities.use_argument_group>`
if you need to do especially complex things with ``argparse`` such
as mutually exclusive sets of options.


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using Parsed Argument Values
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After we call :py:meth:``parser.parse_args()
<argparse.ArgumentParser.parse_args>`` we are left with a ``Namespace``
object containing all the values for our command-line options, both
user-supplied and default.  We use the :py:func:``extract_arguments()
<tracktable.script_helpers.argument_groups.utilities.extract_arguments>``
function to retrieve sets of arguments that we configured using
:py:func:``use_argument_group()
<tracktable.script_helpers.argument_groups.utilities.use_argument_group>``.
Our practice is to define handler functions that take every argument
in a group so that we can write code like the following::


   def setup_trajectory_source(point_source, args):
       trajectory_args = argument_groups.extract_arguments("trajectory_assembly", args)
       source = example_trajectory_builder.configure_trajectory_builder(
           **trajectory_args
          )
       source.input = point_source

       return source.trajectories()

Since we are not required to refer to the individual arguments
directly the user can take advantage of new capabilities added to the
underlying modules whether or not we know about them when we write our
script.

.. todo:: Add tracktable.script_helpers.argument_groups to the documentation

.. _userguide-response-files:

--------------
Response Files
--------------

.. todo:: Document response files in full

Once we start calling scripts with more than 3 or 4 options it becomes
difficult to keep track of all the arguments and difficult to edit the
command line.  We address this with *response files*, textual listings
of command-line options and their values that we can pass to scripts.
The standard Python ``argparse`` module has limited support for
response files.  We expand upon it with our own extended ``argparse``.

Fuller documentation is coming soon.  This should be enough to get you started::

     $ cd tracktable/Python/tracktable/examples
     $ python heatmap_from_csv.py --write-response-file > heatmap_response_file.txt

Now open up ``heatmap_response_file.txt`` in your favorite editor.
Lines that begin with ``#`` are comments.  Uncomment any arguments you
please and add or change values for them.  After you save the file,
run the script as follows::

     $ python heatmap_from_csv.py @heatmap_response_file.txt

That will tell the script to read arguments from
``heatmap_response_file.txt`` as well as from the command line.

You can freely mix response files and standard arguments on a single
command line.  You can also use multiple response files.  The
following command line would be perfectly valid::

     $ python make_movie.py @hd_movie_params.txt @my_favorite_map.txt movie_outfile.mkv

Have fun!
