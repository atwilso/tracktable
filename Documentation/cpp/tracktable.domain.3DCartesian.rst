===================
3D Cartesian Domain
===================


Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 3D Cartesian domain (``tracktable::domain::cartesian3d``) concerns
points in a flat 3D space.  These points are located with respect to
the origin.  Unlike the terrestrial domain, there are no
discontinuities or distinguished points apart from the origin.

Units
^^^^^

Position in 3D Cartesian space is denoted (x, y, z).  You, the user, can
decide what those axes mean.  Without a tie to some underlying
physical domain they are purely abstract.  Distances in this space are
measured in dimensionless units.  Speed is measured in units per
second.
