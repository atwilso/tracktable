Welcome to Tracktable!
======================

Tracktable's purpose is to load, assemble, analyze and render the
paths traced out by moving objects.  We combine the best tools and
techniques we can find from both Python and C++ with the intent of
making all of our capabilities easily accessible from both languages.
We want to make it easy to...

* Render trajectories as histograms (heatmaps), track
  plots and movies.
* Run heavy-duty analysis in C++ and manipulate the results quickly in
  Python.
* Couple algorithms from top to bottom:

  - databases to store raw data,

  - filtering and cleaning techniques to assemble points into
    trajectories,

  - computational geometry to characterize them,

  - clustering and spatial data structures to find groups, and

  - visualization to help communicate your findings.

* Have fun!

If you come across problems, please tell us about them so that we can
improve Tracktable in the future!
