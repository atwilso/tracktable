/** Logging: configurable log messages in C++
 *
 * Write log messages from C++ code using the following
 * template:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * TRACKTABLE_LOG(<level>) << "My log message!";
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * where `level` is one of `tracktable::log::trace`,
 * `tracktable::log::debug`, `tracktable::log::info`,
 * `tracktable::log::warning`, `tracktable::log::error`,
 * or `tracktable::log::fatal`.
 *
 * You may want to use 'using namespace tracktable::log' in order to import
 * those symbols and save yourself from typing a lot of colons.
 *
 * Right now there is only a single log sink: standard error. If you need
 * to redirect messages to a file you can use Boost's log module.
 * Treat TRACKTABLE_LOG as if it were BOOST_LOG_TRIVIAL (in fact, it is!)
 * and use Boost's log sinks.

/** Set minimum level at which log messages will be displayed
 *
 * By default, any message with a log level of 'info' or above.
 * This may result in too much output for you. In that case,
 * call this function to increase it. For example, if you only
 * want warnings and errors:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * tracktable::set_log_level(tracktable::log::warning);
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The available log levels are as follows:
 *
 * - trace:   Extremely verbose output about algorithm execution.
 *            You will only need this if you are debugging
 *            Tracktable's internals.
 *
 * - debug:   Moderately verbose output about algorithm execution.
 *            You will probably never need this, although it is
 *            sometimes useful when you need to track down a problem.
 *
 * - info:    Routine, summary information about what's going on,
 *            including start/end notifications for code that takes
 *            a long time to execute such as DBSCAN clustering.
 *            It is always safe to set the log level higher than
 *            `info`.
 *
 * - warning: Something has gone wrong but execution can continue.
 *            Results may be strange or unusable.
 *
 * - error:   Something has gone wrong and execution probably will not
 *            continue.
 *
 * - fatal:   Something has gone very wrong and execution cannot
 *            continue.
 *
 *	@param [in] new_level: Desired minimum log level. Must be of type
