 * tracktable/Core/PlatformDetect.h - Macros to identify what platform we're on
 *
 * In order to provide platform-dependent features like a check on
 * memory usage, we need to determine what platform (operating system)
 * we're on. The cleanest way to do that at compile time is to look
 * at the different symbols defined by the preprocessor.
 *
 * The checks in this header file were written with reference to the
 * following web pages:
 *
 * http://beefchunk.com/documentation/lang/c/pre-defined-c/precomp.html
