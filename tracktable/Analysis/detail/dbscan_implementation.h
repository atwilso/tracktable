/** Cluster points using the DBSCAN algorithm.
 *
 * DBSCAN is a non-parametric clustering algorithm that defines a
 * point in a cluster as "a point with more than N neighbors inside a
 * search radius R".  N and R are user-specified parameters.  The
 * consequence of this definition is that areas of points with a
 * certain minimum density form clusters regardless of their shape.
 *
 * In order to use DBSCAN you must supply the following parameters:
 *
 * - A list of points to cluster.  These can be in any coordinate
 *   system supported by `boost::geometry` and any container that
 *   provides begin() and end() iterators.
 *
 * - A search box: the distance that a point can be in any dimension
 *   in order to count as "nearby".  Note that we use a search box
 *   instead of the sphere that the original DBSCAN implementation
 *   requires.  This helps when you have a space where different
 *   dimensions have different meaning such as longitude/latitude
 *   (sensible values are on the order of 0-200 in each dimension) and
 *   altitude (sensible values are up to 15000 meters).
 *
 * - A minimum cluster size: Any point that has at least this many
 *   points within its search box is part of a cluster.
 *
 * If you would rather use a slightly more convenient interface
 * please refer to the functions in
 * `Analysis/ComputeDBSCANClustering.h`.
 *
 *
 * For more information about the DBSCAN algorithm please refer to the
 * original paper: Ester, Martin; Kriegel, Hans-Peter; Sander, JÃ¶rg;
 * Xu, Xiaowei (1996). "A density-based algorithm for discovering
 * clusters in large spatial databases with noise". In Simoudis,
 * Evangelos; Han, Jiawei; Fayyad, Usama M. "Proceedings of the Second
 * International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining
