/*
 * ComputeDBSCANClustering - Convenient driver functions for DBSCAN
 * ================================================================
 *
 * Overview
 * --------
 *
 * We have two goals here. First, give you a one-function interface
 * to DBSCAN: pass in a list of points, a search box and a minimum
 * cluster size, get back a vector of (vertex ID, cluster ID) labels.
 * Second, make it easy to say "These points are actually on the
 * surface of a sphere but I want you to pretend that they're in
 * Cartesian space."
 *
 * Rationale
 * ---------
 *
 * Our implementation of DBSCAN is templated on point type and uses
 * boost::geometry for all of its distance math. This means that it
 * will automatically adapt to whatever coordinate system you're using
 * for your points as long as Boost knows what to do with it.
 *
 * This is usually great. However, there are times when it will slow
 * you down tremendously. For example, if you're clustering a bunch
 * of points that are very close together on the surface of a sphere,
 * you might do just fine by pretending that the space is Cartesian
 * (flat) instead of spherical. That will run dramatically more
 * quickly and with greater precision than the trigonometry necessary
 * for doing distance computations on a sphere.

/** Generate cluster labels for a set of points.
 *
 * This function runs DBSCAN on a list of points and returns its
 * results as a vector of integers, one for each input point.
 *
 * When you call `cluster_with_dbscan` you must indicate the type of
 * point (and thus the coordinate space) that you want to use for the
 * clustering. This lets you choose (for example) to run in Cartesian
 * space rather than longitude/latitude space if you're sure your
 * points don't run into the poles or the longitude discontinuity at
 * +/= 180.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code
 *
 * typedef tracktable::cartesian2d::BasePoint point2d;
 * std::vector<tracktable::cartesian2d::BasePoint> my_points;
 * std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> cluster_labels;
 * point2d search_box(0.5, 0.5);
 * int min_cluster_size = 10;
 *
 *
 * int num_clusters = cluster_with_dbscan<point2d>(
 *    my_points.begin(),
 *    my_points.end(),
 *    search_box,
 *    min_cluster_size,
 *    std::back_inserter(cluster_labels)
 * );
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The search box must be specified in the coordinate system in which
 * you want to do the clustering.
 *
 * @param [in] input_begin   Iterator for beginning of input points
 * @param [in] input_end     Iterator for end of input points
 * @param [in] search_box_half_span  Distance defining "nearby" in all dimensions
 * @param [in] minimum_cluster_size  Minimum number of neighbors for core points
 * @param [out] output_sink  (Vertex ID, Cluster ID) for each point
 * @return Number of clusters discovered
 *
 * You can also pass in points as a `std::pair<MyPoint, Foo>` where Foo
 * is your own arbitrary ID. In that case, the returned labels will
 * be (Foo, int).

/** Convert cluster labels into cluster membership lists
 *
 * The label output from `cluster_with_dbscan` is a list of (vertex_id,
 * cluster_id) pairs. It is often useful to have cluster membership
 * represented instead as lists of the vertices that belong to each
 * cluster. This function converts a list of IDs to a list of
 * members. The output will be saved as a sequence of `std::vector`s
 * written in order of ascending cluster ID.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * @code
 * typedef std::pair<my_point, my_id> labeled_point_type;
 * tyepdef std::pair<my_id, int> cluster_label_type;
 * std::vector<labeled_point_type> my_labeled_points;
 * std::vector<cluster_label_type> cluster_labels;
 *
 * int num_clusters = tracktable::cluster_with_dbscan(

 *    search_box,
