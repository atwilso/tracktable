"""tracktable.rw.point: Readers and writers for points

Here you will find convenience functions for instantiating and
configuring point readers (trajectory points or base points)
given the name of the domain and the parameters you want to apply.

TODO: Add support for point writers as well.

    domain='terrestrial',

    object_id_column=0,

    """Instantiate and configure a trajectory point reader.

    Tracktable point readers live in the domain modules:
    `tracktable.domain.<domain_name>.TrajectoryPointReader`
    where `domain_name` is one of `terrestrial`, `cartesian2d`
    or `cartesian3d`. This is a convenience function to set
    one up.

    A trajectory point must have all of the following elements:

    1.
        An object ID. We use the object ID to group points into
        trajectories.
    2.
        A timestamp. For the purposes of this function, that timestamp
        must be in the format 'YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS' where YYYY is the
        4-digit year, mm is the 2-digit month, dd is the 2-digit day of
        the month, and HH:MM:SS are the 2-digit hours, minutes, and
        seconds within the day, respectively.
    3.
        Coordinates. For the terrestrial domain, these coordinates are
        longitude and latitude. For the cartesian2d domain, these are
        x and y. The cartesian3d domain adds z.

    By default, we look for the object ID in column 0, the timestamp in
    column 1, longitude (or x) in column 2, latitude (or y) in column 3,
    and the Z coordinate in column 4. We only pay attention to the
    coordinate assignments for the selected point domain.

    You may also specify other fields to be added to each point. See the
    documentation for the `string_fields`, `real_fields` and `time_fields`
    keyword arguments.

    This function will probably move into the main library at some point
    soon. We will keep a binding here to avoid breaking existing code.

    Arguments:
        infile (file-like object): Source for trajectory point data

    Keyword arguments:
        comment_character (character): Any row where this is the first
            non-whitespace character will be ignored. (default '#')
        delimiter (character): What character separates columns?
            (default ',')
        domain (str): Which point domain will the points belong to?
            (default 'terrestrial')
        object_id_column (int): Which column contains the object ID
            (default 0)
        timestamp_column (int): Which column contains the timestamp
            (default 1)
        longitude_column (int): Which column contains the longitude for
            each point? (default 2, assumes terrestrial domain)
        latitude_column (int): Which column contains the latitude for
            each point? (default 3, assumes terrestrial domain)
        x_column (int): Which column contains the X coordinate for
            each point? (default 2, assumes cartesian2d or cartesian3d)
        y_column (int): Which column contains the Y coordinate for
            each point? (default 3, assumes cartesian2d or cartesian3d)
        z_column (int): Which column contains the X coordinate for
            each point? (default 4, assumes cartesian3d)
        string_fields (dict, int -> string): Columns in the input that
            should be attached to each point as a string. The keys
            in this dictionary are column numbers. Their corresponding
            values are the name of the field that will be added to
            the point's properties. (default: empty)
        real_fields (dict, int -> string): Columns in the input that
            should be attached to each point as a real number. The keys
            in this dictionary are column numbers. Their corresponding
            values are the name of the field that will be added to
            the point's properties. (default: empty)
        time_fields (dict, int -> string): Columns in the input that
            should be attached to each point as a timestamp. The keys
            in this dictionary are column numbers. Their corresponding
            values are the name of the field that will be added to
            the point's properties. The timestamps must be in the same
            format as for the point as a whole, namely `YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`.
            (default: empty)

    Returns:
        Trajectory point reader from the appropriate domain with all fields
        configured according to arguments. Iterate over the reader object
        to retrieve the points.
