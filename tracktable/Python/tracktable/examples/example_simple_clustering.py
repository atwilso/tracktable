# # Trajectory Clustering Example
#
# This is a simple end-to-end clustering example using feature vectors.
# In this example, we cluster based on the convex hull area and the end to
# end distance. This can give us similar shaped trajectories that travel
# the same distance.

import matplotlib


# First, we will define our method to grab the features we want. Given a trajectory,
# the method will build a list of features that we want to define our trajectory. In
# this instance, we get the convex hull area and we calculate the end to end distance
# of the trajectory. We convert the list of features into a feature vector.
