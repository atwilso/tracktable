# generate_heatmap_sample_data - Generate the data file points_near_big_cities.tsv

# Our heatmap sample data file contains points sampled randomly in the
# vicinity of large cities.  If you want to generate a similar file
# with different parameters or just want to know how it works, use and
# modify this script.
#
# The example data in tracktable/Examples/Data/HeatmapSamplePoints.tsv
# was generated with the following command line:

# python generate_heatmap_sample_data.py 500 100 HeatmapSamplePoints.tsv
