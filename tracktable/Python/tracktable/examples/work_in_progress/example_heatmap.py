"""heatmap_from_points.py - Example of how to render a 2D geographic heatmap using points in a CSV file


This is both an example of how to use the library and a convenient
script that you can use to get started quickly.  You must provide as
input a delimited text file with at least 4 columns: object_id,
timestamp, longitude, latitude.  (All columns beyond those first four
will be ignored.)  The points in this file will be rendered onto a map
of part of the world.

You can control the following aspects of the rendering:

- Which part of the world is displayed in the map.  This defaults to
  the whole world but can be changed with the --map argument.  Your
  options are 'world', 'conus' (continental US), 'north_america' and
  'europe'.

- Which colormap is used to render the colors.  This defaults to the
  'gist_heat' thermal scale built into matplotlib.  You may specify
  the name of another if you prefer.  Note that you can only use the
  predefined colormaps here.  If you need a custom colormap, use this
  script as a starting point for your own code.

- The mapping from point density to color.  This defaults to 'linear'
  but you may also specify 'logarithmic' (or 'log' for short).

- The size of each histogram bin.  To create bins that are 0.5 degree
  on a side you would say '--histogram-bin-size 0.5'.

- The resolution of the output image with '--resolution 800 600' or
  whatever you choose.

- The output format.  This is automatically deduced from the output
  filename.

- The DPI of the output image.  Defaults to 72 (typical screen
  resolution).  Note that this will affect things like line thickness
  for borders: matplotlib sizes those things in points rather than
  pixels.

- Whether to draw continent boundaries, country borders,
  latitude/longitude graticules and (within North America) state
  borders.  By default all four are turned on.  Use
  '--omit-continents', '--omit-countries', '--omit-states' and
  '--omit-lonlat' to turn them off.  These will by default be drawn
  over the top of the histogram.

- The delimiter used to separate columns in the text file.  You can
  specify any single character to the '--delimiter' option or the
  magic strings 'tab' or '\t'.  (If it's easy for you to type in a
  literal tab then go ahead.  Just be sure to quote it.)

- Whether or not to draw cities, either with --draw-largest-cities
  or --draw-cities-above-size.
