    "\n",
    "For each trajectory, we will use Tracktable to generate a score for \"boxiness\", where 0 indicates no \"boxiness\" and 1 indicates that a trajectory moves an equal distance in only four directions, and that those four directions are at 90-degree intervals.  In some datasets, such as maritime data, this behavior is especially anomalous, and this will allow us to examine the highest-scoring trajectories for unusual behavior.\n",

    "<details closed>\n",
    "    <summary><b>Algorithm Details</b></summary>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    For a given trajectory, we first examine a histogram of the headings for every linear segment of the trajectory, binned to the nearest degree (i.e. bins for 0, 1, ..., and 359 degrees).  We will deviate from traditional binning: instead of adding a value of one for each segment with a given heading, we add the length of the segment.  This is done to allow for nonuniform sampling along our trajectory.  Once all segment lengths have been added to the respective heading bins, we normalize by dividing by the length of the trajectory.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    If there is a box present in our data, we expect this histogram to have peaks at four bins spaced in 90-degree intervals.  For this reason, we multiply to form <span style=\"color:#00add0\"><b>quartets</b></span> that represent a score for each of these possible rotated boxes.  That is, we multiply the bin values at 0, 90, 180 and 270 degrees to get a score for the 0-degree quartet.  We would expect this number to be higher if there is a box at this 0-90-180-270 orientation, and lower (or zero) if not.  The 1-degree quartet is found by multiplying the bin values at 1, 91, 181, and 271 degrees, and so on, until we have quartets 0 through 89.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    Roughly speaking, each quartet represents a score proportional to the likelihood that the trajectory creates a box at a given orientation.  If we sum these values, then a uniform headings histogram would yield a maximum boxiness score, which is not desirable.  So instead, we use a window (by default 5 degrees wide) centered at the maximum quartet value to score our trajectory for \"boxiness\".   \n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    Lastly, we normalize by the largest possible quartet, (0.25)^4, so that <span style=\"color:#00add0\"><b>a perfect box will have a \"boxiness\" score of 1</b></span>.\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    <b><span style=\"color:#81062e\">Note:</span></b> We use this method because trajectories creating perfect boxes are guaranteed to have high \"boxiness\" scores.  However, it's important to note that it is possible for other trajectories to score high despite not having boxes.  For instance, the two trajectories below will both have a perfect boxiness score of 1:\n",

    "        <li>A trajectory that travels due north for 10km, then due east for 10km, then due south for 10km, then due west for 10km, forming a perfect square.</li>\n",
    "        <li>A trajectory that travels due south for 10km, then due east for 5km, then due west for 10km, then due east for 5km, then due north for 10km, making a 90 degree angular pattern but <b>not</b> a box.</li>\n",
