Do the same calculation again, but for each half.  That is, take the distance between the start point and the midpoint of the trajectory (as the crow flies) and divide by the distance traveled along the trajectory from the start point to the midpoint.  Save that as the second value in the feature vector.  Then take the distance between the midpoint and the endpoint and divide by the distance traveled along the trajectory between those points.  This is the third value in the feature vector.</li>\n",

    "    ... and so on.  We stop when we reach a preset \"depth\" which is the largest number of segments that we divide our trajectory into.  For instance, a depth of 4 will yield a 10-dimensional feature vector.  In this way, the distance geometry feature vector encapsulates the straightness of the trajectory across proportionally smaller and smaller segments, and thus gives a concise and comparable representation of shape for the trajectory.
