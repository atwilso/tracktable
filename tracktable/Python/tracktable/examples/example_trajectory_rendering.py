# **Purpose:** Sample code to render assembled trajectories
# In some cases, you may wish to read in trajectories with certain constraints. For example, we can have trajectories with a minimum number of points. Or we acknowledge that the points in the trajectory should be within a certain time and/or distance threshold to belong to the same trajectory. The Trajectory Builder does this.

# It is possible the scale of the selected map is not appropriate for the trajectories you wish to render. The rendered example map is of the continental United States (CONUS for short). This is one of the preset convenience maps and was set as the map name when we called the render function. Other convenience maps are europe, north_america, south_america, australia and world.

# Let us expand our view using another custom map.
