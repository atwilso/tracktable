# # Trajectory Clustering Example
#
# This notebook is an end-to-end example of how to cluster trajectories in Tracktable using distance geometry.  It goes through the following steps:
#
# 1.  Read in points from a file.
# 2.  Assemble those points into trajectories.
# 3.  Create a distance geometry signature for each trajectory.
# 4.  Using those signatures as feature vectors, compute clusters using DBSCAN.
# 5.  Print statistics about each cluster.
# 6.  Render the resulting clusters onto a map.
#
# Eventually, distance geometry computation will move into the library itself.

# Set up Matplotlib to render in a notebook before anyone else can change its back end.

# Compute an N-point distance geometry signature
#
# Distance geometry is a technique for characterizing a curve in space by measuring the distances between evenly spaced points (called control points) on the curve. This implementation has three parameters:
#   1. A trajectory
#   2. The number of control points
#   3. Whether to normalize the distances in the signature so that the largest distance is always 1.
#
# The number of control points controls the fidelity of the resulting signature. The more control points, the more accurately the features of the curve can be represented, but the longer it takes to compute.
#
# Normalizing the distance allows shape-based comparison between trajectories by taking the dot product of their respective distance geometry signatures. The higher the dot product, the more similar the trajectories. There are many possible normalization schemes; this is the one we find useful.
#
# Returns:
#   tracktable.domain.feature_vectors.FeatureVectorNN where NN is the size of the resulting distance geometry signature.
