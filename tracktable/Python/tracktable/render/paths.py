tracktable.render.paths - Functions to render trajectories as curves on a map

If you're trying to figure out how to render a bunch of trajectories,
take a look at draw_traffic and at
tracktable/examples/render_trajectories_from_csv.py.  Those will get you
pointed in the right direction.

    """Create a new trajectory with no adjacent duplicate points

    Duplicate positions in a trajectory lead to degenerate line
    segments.  This, in turn, gives some of the back-end renderers
    fits.  The cleanest thing to do is to use the input trajectory to
    compute a new one s.t. no segments are degenerate.

    There's still one problem case: if the entire trajectory is a
    single position, you will get back a trajectory where the only two
    points (beginning and end) are at the same position.

    Parameters in more detail:


    ``traffic_map``: Map instance (no default)

    Cartopy GeoAxes instance of the space in which trajectories will be
    rendered.  We don't actually render into this object.  Instead we
    use it to project points from longitude/latitude space down into
    the map's local coordinate system.  Take a look at
    tracktable.render.maps for several ways to create this map including
    a few convenience functions for common regions.

    ``trajectory_iterable``: iterable(Trajectory) (no default)

    Sequence of Trajectory objects.  We will traverse this exactly
    once.  It can be any Python iterable.

    ``color_map``: Matplotlib color map or string (default 'BrBG')

    Either a Matplotlib color map object or a string denoting the name
    of a registered color map.  See the Matplotlib documentation for
    the names of the built-ins and the tracktable.render.colormaps
    module for several more examples and a way to create your own.

    ``color_scale``: Matplotlib color normalizer (default Normalize())

    Object that maps your scalar range onto a colormap.  This will
    usually be either matplotlib.colors.Normalize() or
    matplotlib.colors.LogNorm() for linear and logarithmic mapping
    respectively.

    ``trajectory_scalar_generator``: function(Trajectory) -> list(float)

    You can color each line segment in a trajectory with your choice
    of scalars.  This argument must be a function that computes those
    scalars for a trajectory or else None if you don't care.  The
    scalar function should take a Trajectory as its input and return a
    list of len(trajectory) - 1 scalars, one for each line segment to
    be drawn.

    ``trajectory_linewidth_generator``: function(Trajectory) -> list(float)

    Just as you can generate a scalar (and thus a color) for each line
    segment, you can also generate a width for that segment.  If you
    supply a value for this argument then it should take a Trajectory
    as its input and return a list of len(trajectory)-1 scalars
    specifying the width for each segment.  This value is measured in
    points.  If you need a single linewidth all the way through use
    the 'linewidth' argument.

    ``linewidth``: float (default 0.1)

    This is the stroke width measured in points that will be used to
    draw the line segments in each trajectory.  If you need different
    per-segment widths then use trajectory_linewidth_generator.

    ``dot_size``: float (default 2)

    If this value is non-zero then a dot will be drawn at the head of
    each trajectory.  It will be dot_size points in radius and will be
    colored with whatever scalar is present at the head of the
    trajectory.

    TODO: Add a dot_size_generator argument to allow programmatic
    control of this argument.

    ``label_objects``: boolean (default False)

    You can optionally label the head of each trajectory.  To do so
    you must supply 'label_objects=True' and also a function for the
    label_generator argument.

    ``label_generator``: function(TrajectoryPoint) -> string

    Construct a label for the specified trajectory.  The result must
    be a string.  This argument is ignored if label_objects is False.

    TODO: Test whether Unicode strings will work here.

    ``label_text_kwargs``: dict (default empty)

    We ultimately render labels using matplotlib.axes.Text().  If you
    want to pass in arguments to change the font, font size, angle or
    other parameters, specify them here.

    ``axes``: matplotlib.axes.Axes (default pyplot.gca())

    This is the axis frame that will hold the Matplotlib artists that
    will render the trajectories.  By default it will be whatever
    pyplot thinks the current axis set is.

    ``zorder``: int (default 8)

    Height level where the trajectories will be drawn.  If you want
    them to be on top of the map and anything else you draw on it then
    make this value large.  It has no range limit.

    ``log_function``: function(string) (default sys.stderr.write)

    The draw_paths function generates occasional status messages.  It
    will pass them to this function.  You can use this to display them
    to the user, write them to a file or ignore them entirely.
