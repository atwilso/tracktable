"""Options for creating trajectories from points.

This argument group lets you control the parameters for the algorithm
that assembles sequences of time-stamped points into continuous
trajectories.

Arguments:

| ``--separation-distance NUMBER``
|   A gap of at least this many units between successive points will result in a new trajectory.
|
| ``--separation-time NUMBER``
|   A gap of at least this many MINUTES between successive points will result in a new trajectory.
|
| ``--minimum-length NUMBER``
|   Discard finished trajectories with fewer than this many points.
