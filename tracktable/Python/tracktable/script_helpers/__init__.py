    This function is an adapter for an iterable that returns
    objects N at a time instead of one at a time.

    Example:
		>>> list(n_at_a_time(range(10), 3, -1))
		[(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8), (9, -1, -1)]

	Args:
		iterable {sequence}: Data source
		howmany {int}: How many elements to take at a time
		fillvalue {any}: Value to pad with if the iterable runs out

	Returns:
		New sequence whose elements are tuples of elements from
		the original iterable
