    """Compute distance geometry signature sampled by length

    This function computes the multilevel distance geometry
    for a given trajectory. Each level *d* approximates the
    input trajectory with *d* equal-length line segments.
    The distance geometry values for that level are the lengths
    of all *d* line segments, normalized to lie between 0 and 1.
    A value of 1 indicates the length of the entire trajectory.

    The D-level distance geometry for a curve will result in
    (D * (D+1)) / 2  separate values.

    This implementation creates the endpoints of the line segments
    by sampling the trajectory at fractions of total distance
    traveled. To sample by total duration, use
    distance_geometry_by_time().

    Arguments:
        trajectory (Tracktable trajectory): Input curve to analyze
        depth (int): How many levels to compute. Must
            be greater than zero.

    Returns:
        List of distance geometry values laid out consecutively by
        increasing depth.
