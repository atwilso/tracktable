def interleave_points_by_timestamp(*point_sources):
    """From a series of point sources, generate a new sequence sorted by timestamp.

    Given one or more point sources that are themselves sorted by
    timestamp, generate a new sequence containing all of the points
    from all sources, again sorted by increasing timestamp.

    Note that this function reads all the points into memory in order
    to build a priority queue. If you're feeling ambitious, feel free
    to write a new version that keeps only a single point in memory
    from each source at any time.

    Args:
       *point_sources (iterables): One or more iterables of points

    Yields:
       TrajectoryPoint instances sorted by increasing timestamp
