tracktable.applications.prediction - Predict trajectory end point

We can use a database of already-seen trajectories to try to find matches
for a newly identified trajectory.  We do this by breaking up our
already-seen trajectories into fragments, computing a feature vector for
each one, and storing that feature vector in an R-tree.  Then, when we
want to predict where a new trajectory might be going, we compute a
feature vector for it and look for the nearest neighbor in our R-tree.

Like many prediction methods, this is not guaranteed to find the right
answer every time (especially when observing trajectories that don't
behave like anything else).  The exact success rate depends on the
quality of the match between the new trajectory and history.
