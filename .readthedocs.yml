# Configuration file for building documentation on readthedocs.org

# Ordinarily, Tracktable expects all of its build configuration to be
# done by CMake, including the hassle of filling out paths that are
# only known at runtime.
#
# ReadTheDocs doesn't use CMake.  (Thank goodness.)  It wants to be
# able to build straight from a newly cloned repository whenever
# possible using settings common to most pure-Python projects.
#
# This file contains configuration options to reach a happy medium.
#
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for
# details.

  # This Conda environment (per the Read The Docs documentation, URL below)
  # uses libmamba to handle conda install requests.  That should be much,
  # much faster than the old version.

      # by default on RTD so we need to grab it.
