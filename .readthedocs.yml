# Configuration file for building documentation on readthedocs.org

# Ordinarily, Tracktable expects all of its build configuration to be
# done by CMake, including the hassle of filling out paths that are
# only known at runtime.
#
# ReadTheDocs doesn't use CMake.  (Thank goodness.)  It wants to be
# able to build straight from a newly cloned repository whenever
# possible using settings common to most pure-Python projects.
#
# This file contains configuration options to reach a happy medium.
#
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html for
# details.

# Build documentation in the Documentation/ directory using Sphinx.

build:

  # This Conda environment (per the Read The Docs documentation, URL below)
  # uses libmamba to handle conda install requests.  That should be much,
  # much faster than the old version.

      ### Notebooks are stored pre-rendered in Git LFS.  This isn't installed
      ### by default on RTD.  Rather than use their recipe at the URL listed
      ### below, we install LFS in the Conda environment and use it from
      ### there.

      ### Here's their recipe in case you need it:

      ###
      ### Note that it doesn't quite work out of the box.  You will need to
      ### adjust it for (1) the latest git-lfs release at the provided URL
      ### and (2) the directory into which that release unpacks itself.
