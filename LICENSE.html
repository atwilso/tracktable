      <p>
	THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
	COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR
	DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE
	OF THIS AGREEMENT.
      </p>

      <p><b>
	1. DEFINITIONS
      </b></p>

      <p>
      "Contribution" means:
      </p>

      <p>
	a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
	documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
      </p>

      <p>
	b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      </p>

      <p>
	i) changes to the Program, and
      </p>

      <p>
	ii) additions to the Program;
      </p>

      <p>
	where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate
	from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A
	Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added
	to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on
	such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include
	additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of
	software distributed in conjunction with the Program under
	their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works
	of the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
	"Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
	"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a
	Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale
	of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
	"Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance
	with this Agreement.
      </p>

      <p>
      "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this
      Agreement, including all Contributors.
      </p>

      <p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>

      <p>
	a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
	hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
	royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare
	derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
	distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
	Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code
	and object code form.
      </p>

      <p>
	b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor
	hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,
	royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make,
	use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the
	Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
	object code form.  This patent license shall apply to the
	combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the
	time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such
	addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
	covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not
	apply to any other combinations which include the
	Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.
      </p>

      <p>
	c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants
	the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no
	assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program
	does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
	rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any
	liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
	based on infringement of intellectual property rights or
	otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and
	licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole
	responsibility to secure any other intellectual property
	rights needed, if any.  For example, if a third party patent
	license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the
	Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that
	license before distributing the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
	d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
	sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to
	grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
      </p>

      <p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>

      <p>
	A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object
	code form under its own license agreement, provided that:
      </p>

      <p>
	a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this
	Agreement; and
      </p>
      <p>b) its license agreement:</p>

      <p>
	i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all
	warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
	warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
	implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
	for a particular purpose;
      </p>

      <p>
	ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all
	liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
	incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
      </p>

      <p>
	iii) states that any provisions which differ from this
	Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any
	other party; and
      </p>

      <p>
	iv) states that source code for the Program is available from
	such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a
	reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
	software exchange.
      </p>

      <p>
	When the Program is made available in source code form:
      </p>

      <p>
	a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
      </p>

      <p>
	b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
	the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
	Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices
	contained within the Program.
      </p>

      <p>
	Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its
	Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent
	Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.
      </p>

      <p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>

      <p>
	Commercial distributors of software may accept certain
	responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners
	and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the
	commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes
	the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
	manner which does not create potential liability for other
	Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program
	in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
	("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and
	indemnify every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor")
	against any losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses")
	arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought
	by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
	extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial
	Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
	in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
	section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any
	actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
	to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly
	notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,
	and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and
	cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
	any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified
	Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
	expense.
      </p>

      <p>
	For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a
	commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is
	then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor
	then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to
	Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
	Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this
	section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend
	claims against the other Contributors related to those
	performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any
	other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the
	Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.
      </p>

      <p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>

      <p>
	EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM
	IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR
	CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING,
	WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
	NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
	PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining
	the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and
	assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under
	this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
	costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,
	damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and
	unavailability or interruption of operations.
      </p>

      <p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>

      <p>
	EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER
	RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR
	ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
	CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
	PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY,
	WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
	NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR
	DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
	GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
	DAMAGES.
      </p>

      <p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>

      <p>
	If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable
	under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
	enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
	Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto,
	such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent
	necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
      </p>

      <p>
	If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a
	Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software
	(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then
	any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
	Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date
	such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes
	patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim
	or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself
	(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
	hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such
	Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate
	as of the date such litigation is filed.
      </p>

      <p>
	All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if
	it fails to comply with any of the material terms or
	conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in
	a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such
	noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement
	terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of
	the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,
	Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
	granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
	and survive.
      </p>

      <p>
	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this
	Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement
	is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following
	manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish
	new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time
	to time.  No one other than the Agreement Steward has the
	right to modify this Agreement.  IBM is the initial Agreement
	Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the
	Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new
	version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
	version number. The Program (including Contributions) may
	always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement
	under which it was received. In addition, after a new version
	of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to
	distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the
	new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and
	2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the
	intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,
	whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All
	rights in the Program not expressly granted under this
	Agreement are reserved.
      </p>

      <p>
	This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New
	York and the intellectual property laws of the United States
	of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal
	action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause
	of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial
	in any resulting litigation.
