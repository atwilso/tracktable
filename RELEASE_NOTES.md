# Tracktable Release Notes

## VERSION 1.4.0, 14 October 2020

This is a feature release.

### NEW FEATURES SINCE 1.3.1

The main feature is an implementation of ECEF (Earth Centered / Earth Fixed) coordinates.  ECEF coordinates (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECEF)) are a 3D Cartesian space where the Earth lies centered within the cube whose corners are [-1, -1, -1] and [1, 1, 1].  This coordinate frame rotates with the Earth: x=0 will always be aligned with the prime meridian.

You can get an ECEF version of a terrestrial point by calling :python:`tracktable.core.geomath.ECEF(my_point, altitude_field="altitude")`, :python:`tracktable.core.geomath.ECEF_from_feet(my_point, altitude_in_feet)`, and :python:`tracktable.core.geomath.ECEF_from_meters(my_point, altitude_in_meters)`.  These functions are also available in C++ as members of :cpp:`tracktable::domain::terrestrial::TerrestrialTrajectoryPoint`.

We have also added a `clone()` method to trajectories in Python.  This will return a new copy of a trajectory instead of a pointer to the original.  This method is unneeded in C++: :cpp:`new_trajectory = original_trajectory` will suffice.

We have updated the insert() method for trajectories in Python to allow multiple points to be inserted with one function call.  Similarly, slicing a trajectory (like any other list) will now return a new trajectory that inherits its parent's metadata.

Interactive trajectory rendering is available in :python:`tracktable.render.render_trajectories.render_trajectories()`.  This will use [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) if you are inside a Jupyter notebook and [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) otherwise.  We intend to clean up the API for trajectory rendering for 1.5.0.

Alert readers will notice some infrastructure for test data generators.  These are still work in progress and are slated for release in 1.5.0.

The latest release in our Github repository (https://github.com/sandialabs/tracktable) is now on branch 'main'.  The branch named 'master' is deprecated and will be emptied out in release 1.5.0 except for a text file pointing visitors to the branch 'main'.

### BUGS FIXED SINCE 1.3.1

Many undocumented functions and methods are now documented.  This is a major effort under way.  We encourage users to send us bug reports on documentation that is missing or still in error.

Specific issues:

* #86: Avoid a divide-by-zero issue when rendering trajectories that don't move

* #212: Propagate coordinate system through Cartopy rendering so data stays aligned with map

* #245: Distance geometry values were not being scaled properly

* #250: Spherical clustering option is missing on DBSCAN bindings


### KNOWN ISSUES IN 1.4.0

Functions in binary extension classes are not yet included in the documentation.  

Point readers will trip an assertion and probably crash when reading a file that does not end with a newline.




## VERSION 1.3.1, 21 July 2020

This is a patch release.  

### NEW FEATURES SINCE 1.3.0

* This release includes the beta launch of interactive trajectory rendering in Jupyter notebooks using [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/).  There is an example of how to do this in the Render_Trajectories example notebook.  The notebooks can either be downloaded from Tracktable's web site (
<https://tracktable.sandia.gov/downloads/documentation.html>) or copied from an installation using :python:`tracktable.examples.copy_example_notebooks('/where/to/put/them')`.  Expect tweaks to the API for interactive trajectories between now and the official launch in 1.4.0.

* The trajectory writers (:python:`tracktable.domain.<domain>.TrajectoryWriter`) will now accept single trajectories as well as lists of trajectories as arguments to `write()`.  

* New function: :python:`tracktable.info.cities.get_city()` will retrieve City objects based on spelling, location, or country.

* New function: :python:`tracktable.analysis.dbscan.cluster_labels_to_dict` will create a dictionary containing cluster IDs and feature vectors that can easily be converted to a [Pandas] DataFrame.  We would like to hear feedback on how this function could better suit your use case.

* Added capability: Trajectories in C++ now have reverse iterators and explicit functions for const iterators.  Added `rbegin()`, `rend()`, `crbegin()` and `crend()`.  

### BUGS FIXED SINCE 1.3.0

(Note: the issue numbers are internal to our development process.  We don't yet have a way to expose our issue queue to the outside world.)

* Issue #181: Cartopy maps have wrong aspect ratio when min_longitude and max_longitude are the same.  

* Issue #182: :python:`tracktable.examples.copy_example_notebooks()` will now create the destination directory for you if it does not already exist.

* Issue #184: In an attempt to make PointReader quieter, we accidentally made it even noisier.  

* Issue #76: The Simple Clustering example refers to a data set that is not included in Tracktable.  We've moved the notebook back into Work In Progress status until we can fix this.

* Issue #202: If you install Tracktable's Python package on a very, very new Windows system, you might be missing the Visual C++ runtime.  This is now mentioned in our documentation and FAQ.  We don't currently have a way to distribute that ourselves.

### HOTFIXES SINCE 1.3.0

We launched 1.3.0 without the Jupyter notebooks in the wheel.  Oops.  

### KNOWN ISSUES

We believe there are no major bugs loose at the moment.





## VERSION 1.3.0, 19 May 2020

This is a feature release.  

### NEW FEATURES SINCE 1.2

* Distance geometry code has been added to C++ and Python.  Distance geometry is a family of algorithms that operate on curves represented as a (partial)
matrix of distances between points sampled from the curve.  In C++, check out the functions :cpp:`tracktable::distance_geometry_by_distance()` and 
:cpp:`tracktable:distance_geometry_by_time()`.  In Python, check out the module
:python:`tracktable.analysis.distance_geometry`. 

* We now include several Jupyter notebooks as examples of how to use Tracktable.  These are in addition to the scripts in :python:`tracktable.examples`.  You can download the scripts from the Tracktable web site (<https://tracktable.sandia.gov>) or copy them from the installed library with the following commands: 
```python
import tracktable.examples
tracktable.examples.copy_example_notebooks('/path/to/my/notebooks')
```

* Log messages have been cleaned up.  Log output from C++ now uses Boost's logging facilities.  Log output from C++ now uses Python's `logging` module.  The function `tracktable.core.log.set_log_level()` will set the minimum severity for both.  Particularly noisy modules such as the point reader and trajectory assembler are now much quieter.

* We now use the [Libtool library versioning scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html) for the Tracktable shared libraries.  

* We now support Python 3.8.  

* We include support for building RPMs containing Tracktable's shared libraries.  These RPMs do not yet include the Python interface.

* Along with RPM support, we generate a [pkg-config](https://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/pkg-config-guide.html) configuration file.

* Python example scripts for rendering heatmaps, trajectory maps, and making movies are back.

* Terrestrial points have an `ECEF()` method that will return the earth-centered earth-facing (ECEF) coordinates for the point.

* We now require a compiler capable of C++11.  

* It is now possible to generate just the C++ documentation instead of C++ and Python.  The CMake variable `BUILD_DOCUMENTATION_CXX_ONLY` controls this.

### NOTABLE FIXES 

* Boost versions 1.71 and newer were failing to compile due to a CMake issue.
* TrajectoryWriter was failing and sometimes crashing because the destination file would sometimes be closed before its final flush.
* The function `tracktable.core.geomath.convex_hull_aspect_ratio()` would return NaN for degenerate trajectories (those whose convex hull was a single point or line segment).  While this is mathematically correct, we've changed it to return 0 for convenience.  The value 0 should not appear except in degenerate situations.
* `tracktable.core.geomath.speed_between()` was always returning 0.  
* We now use CMake's FindThreads module to find and link against thread libraries.  Some Boost components now require this.




VERSION 1.2.4, 23 January 2019
------------------------------

This is a bugfix release.  There are no new features.

### UPDATES SINCE 1.2.3

No features have been updated or added.

### NOTABLE FIXES

* Remnants of some old logging code were causing `tracktable.render.paths.draw_traffic()` to raise exceptions.
* There was an uncommon case in `tracktable.render.paths.draw_traffic()` that would cause an error if no label generator was set (which is the default).

### HOTFIXES SINCE 1.2.3

No hotfixes have been deployed since 1.2.3.

### KNOWN ISSUES

If you configure a point reader with a coordinate that does not exist for the point type (e.g. `reader.coordinates[2] = 4` for a domain like `terrestrial` that only has coordinates 0 and 1), Tracktable will fail an assertion and exit when the reader loads its data.

VERSION 1.2.3, 18 January 2019
------------------------------

This is a bugfix release.  There are no new features.

We are no longer building Python wheels for Python 2.7.  Python 2.7 is [no longer supported at all](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/) by the Python Software Foundation as of January 1, 2020.  We expect to remove CMake support for Python 2 in Release 1.3, due out in mid-to-late February.


### UPDATES SINCE 1.2.2

* Configuration files now insist upon Boost 1.61 or newer and CMake 3.12 or newer.  There were a few old instances that would only require 1.57 and 2.8, respectively.

### NOTABLE FIXES

* Trajectory assembler now correctly prints its separation duration.
* The Cartopy map example no longer relies on outdated/removed example code.
* There was a bug that caused `tracktable.core.geomath.compute_bounding_box` to fail on trajectories that had been loaded from pickle files instead of assembled from points.  Fixed.

### HOTFIXES SINCE 1.2.2

* No hotfixes have been deployed since 1.2.2.

### KNOWN ISSUES

* Building for Python 3.8 is error-prone because of changes to CMake's infrastructure for finding Boost, Python, and Boost's Python library.  
* There may be trouble building against Boost versions 1.71 and newer because of changes to the way Boost and CMake interact.
* If you build from source on Linux you will probably need to add `-lpthread` to CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS.

VERSION 1.2.2, 2 January 2019
-----------------------------

This is a quality-of-life release.

### UPDATES SINCE 1.2.1

* The C++ function `tracktable::point_at_fraction` and the Python function `tracktable.core.geomath.point_at_fraction` have both been renamed to `point_at_length_fraction` to remove confusion about what they do.  The previous name was ambiguous: was the interpolation fraction being computed with respect to trajectory duration or with respect to travel distance?  In Python, `point_at_fraction` will print a deprecation warning.  In C++, `point_at_fraction` is simply gone.  The deprecated Python binding will be removed in release 1.3.
* Tracktable should be much quieter.  All debug/info/warning/error messages are now directed to a logger instead of writing directly to standard output or standard error.  Right now the C++ and Python messages go to different destinations.  Log messages in C++ go to `boost::log`.  Log messages in Python go to the standard `logging` module.  We will unify these in a future release.  

### HOTFIXES SINCE 1.2.1

No hotfixes have been deployed since the last release.


VERSION 1.2.1, Mid-November 2019
--------------------------------

This is a bug-fix/documentation release.

### DOCUMENTATION UPDATES

* The Installation page in the documentation has had its list of dependencies brought up to date.  It also now contains a recommendation that you install from binary packages on Pip wherever possible.
* There are now Jupyter notebooks in `tracktable/Python/tracktable/examples/notebook_examples`.  We are working through the Python examples one at a time to bring them up to date and provide Jupyter versions.

### NOTABLE FIXES

* Custom map bounding boxes were not working in `tracktable.render.mapmaker.mapmaker()`.  
* Bounding boxes (`tracktable.domain.<domain>.BoundingBox`) were not printing correctly.
* Bounding box corners could not be correctly accessed from Python.  They now show up as properties min_corner and max_corner.
* Bounding boxes can now be constructed from two point-like objects.  A point-like object is anything that can be treated like an array of coordinates.

### HOTFIXES SINCE 1.2.0

* The module `tracktable.source.random_point_source` has been replaced by `tracktable.source.point`, formerly known as `tracktable.source.scatter`.
* The module `tracktable.source` is now included in the installer.
* Link syntax in Markdown README fixed.
* PyPI classifier strings for Linux and OS X fixed.
* Auditwheel now correctly requests `manylinux1` platform tag on Linux.
* README.md now included in wheel.
* Windows build now correctly links against libpython.


VERSION 1.2.0, October 2019
---------------------------

This is a major update.

### NEW FEATURES

* We are now using [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) instead of Basemap to render geographic maps.  Basemap no longer works with recent versions of Matplotlib and is at end-of-life along with Python 2.7.  

* We can now build wheels (Python binary install packages) for Python versions 3.5, 3.6, 3.7, and possibly even 2.7.  We will be uploading these to PyPI so that you can `pip install tracktable` instead of building from source.  We will also make these available for download on our web site.

* Jupyter notebook examples!  They are in the `notebooks` subdirectory under the Python examples, or you can get them as a separate zip file on [our web site](https://tracktable.sandia.gov).

* We finally have a web site!  Visit us at <https://tracktable.sandia.gov>.

* Documentation is now hosted at <https://tracktable.readthedocs.io>.

* Python examples are getting overhauled one by one.  A file named `example_foo.py` will have a fully self-contained example of how to use some specific capability in the library.  The other examples (`heatmap_from_points`, `trajectory_map_from_points` and `movie_from_points`) are ready to run on your own data.

* New module tracktable.io.point with a convenient interface for instantiating point readers (trajectory points and base points).  Soon this will get bindings for point writers as well.

* Points and trajectories can now be serialized using `boost::serialization` or Python's `pickle` module.

### NOTABLE FIXES

* Examples were relying on the nonexistent module `tracktable.source.random_point_source`.  It has been replaced with `tracktable.source.scatter`.  

* `tracktable.io` and `tracktable.analysis` modules were not getting installed by `make install`.  

* Data files for `tracktable.info` were not getting installed by `make install`.

* Timestamp format was not configurable on Python trajectory point reader.

* Point metadata properties are now on trajectory point reader (where they belong) instead of base point reader.

### OUTSTANDING ISSUES

* We expect a few rough edges on the Cartopy support, especially decoration features in `tracktable.render.mapmaker` that don't quite work like they should.

* C++ examples still need cleanup.


VERSION 1.1.1, August 2019
--------------------------

This version includes two bugfixes since 1.1.0:

* The Python module ```tracktable.analysis``` was not being installed
  during ```make install```.
  
* The ```current_length``` property was not exposed on TrajectoryPoint
  instances.

VERSION 1.1.0, May 2019
-----------------------

This version is the last in which we will actively support Python 2.7.
Python 2 is scheduled to 
[end support](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/)
on January 1, 2020.  
Many packages (TensorFlow, Pandas, iPython, Matplotlib, NumPy,
SciPy... see [the Python 3 Statement](https://python3statement.org/)
for the full list) have already dropped support for Python 2.

We also expect that this will be the last version of Tracktable that
uses Basemap for its back-end rendering layer.  Basemap's maintainer
has stated that there will be one final release at the end of 2019
followed by honorable retirement.  We thank the entire Basemap team,
past and present, for their many years of service.


### NEW FEATURES

* Tracktable now has mailing lists!  Send a blank email to
  <listname>-join  at software dot sandia dot gov to request membership.  The
  available lists are:

  * tracktable-announce - Very low volume.  New releases of Tracktable
    will be announced here.
    
  * tracktable-develop - Discussions of new features and changes to
    the library will be conducted here.
    
  * tracktable-commit - Commit messages will be forwarded to this list.
  
* We are moving the repository to GitHub.  Starting with this release,
  the canonical URL will be 
  [https://github.com/sandialabs/tracktable](https://github.com/sandialabs/tracktable)
  with documentation at ReadTheDocs.

* As of Version 1.1, we require Boost 1.61 or newer and CMake 3.0 or newer.

* Functions ``tracktable.core.current_memory_use()`` and
  ``tracktable.core.peak_memory_use()`` are now available.
  
* Functions on trajectories:

  * ``time_at_fraction()`` will give you a point along a trajectory at any
    fraction between beginning and end.
  
* Functions on points:

  * ``extrapolate()`` is like ``interpolate()`` in that it takes two
    points and a floating-point number and interpolates between the
    start and end points according to that float.  Unlike
    ``interpolate()``, it doesn't do any bounds checking: it is perfectly
    legitimate to ask for ``extrapolate(hither, yon, -1.0)``.
  
  * ``distance()`` now computes distance between any combination of
    points and trajectories.

* Clustering with DBSCAN:

  * The DBSCAN interface has been cleaned up.  You will no longer
    instantiate ``tracktable::DBSCAN``.  Instead, call
    ``tracktable::cluster_with_dbscan()``.
    
  * You can decorate the points you feed to DBSCAN.  For example, if
    you want to store your own index, you can pass in a
    ``std::pair<PointType, int>``.
    
* Trajectory I/O using JSON:

  * We now support reading and writing trajectories to JSON in Python.
    Check out the functions ``json_from_trajectory`` and
    ``trajectory_from_json`` in the ``tracktable.io.read_write_json``
    module.  Look for JSON support in C++ in an upcoming version.

* The example scripts in the Python directory now have their own page
  in the documentation.
  

### NOTABLE FIXES

* We can now use Boost versions up to 1.69.  As of Boost 1.67, the
  name of the Python shared library changed in a way that broke our
  build process.  Fixed.  Note, however, that we cannot yet deal with
  CMake-ified versions of Boost.

* We detect Anaconda's Python interpreter on OS X and modify the link
  flags so that loading Tracktable in Python code does not instantly
  generate a segmentation fault.

* Many spurious compilation warnings in Boost have been disabled.  

* Distances in the terrestrial domain are now returned properly in
  kilometers.
  
* We use ``sphinx.autodoc_mock_imports`` in our documentation so that you do not
  need to build the entire toolkit just to create the documentation.
  This still needs a little work to remove the need for CMake.


### OUTSTANDING ISSUES

* The C++ examples need to be cleaned up and documented.  This would
  be a good "getting started" exercise for people who are new to the
  code base.

* There are several useful scripts in
  ``tracktable/Python/tracktable/examples/work_in_progress`` that need
  minor fixes to run with the latest API.


### COMING SOON

* We are experimenting with various replacements for Basemap.  As of
  May 2019 the leading contenders are
  [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) for offline
  rendering and either
  [Folium/Leaflet](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) or
  [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) for interactive rendering.  We welcome
  suggestions and discussion!  Please join the tracktable-develop
  mailing list if you're interested.

* We are almost ready to move our documentation to ReadTheDocs.  Look
  for an announcement on the ``tracktable-announce`` mailing list.
  
* C++11 features will be permitted in new contributions to the library.


--------------------------------------------------------------------


VERSION 1.0.5, March 2018
-------------------------

This is a bug-fix release.

NEW FEATURES
------------

* No new features.


NOTABLE FIXES
-------------

* Writing to files or to file-like objects in Python caused a
  segfault.  See the commit on Feb 21 2018 whose hash begins with
  8db2248d for details.

* C++ headers for convex hulls were not being installed with 'make
  install'.


OUTSTANDING ISSUES
------------------

* Link errors / segfaults under certain OSX configurations, especially
  the Anaconda Python environment.  



----------------------------------------------------------------------


VERSION 1.0.4, November 2017
----------------------------

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Trajectories can be written to and read from JSON and Python
  dictionaries.  At the moment this is only present in Python.  Check
  out tracktable.io.read_write_dictionary and
  tracktable.io.read_write_json.  
  
NOTABLE FIXES
-------------

* References to ``std::cout`` are still in Boost's geometry library.  This
  causes compile problems if I don't work around it.

* ``tracktable.core.Timestamp.from_string()`` should now honor ``%z``
  in Python 3.  Support for the ``%z`` directive is missing in Python
  2.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


VERSION 1.0.3, October 2017
---------------------------

Cleanup release.  We've removed the old Python point writers.  These
were made obsolete by the introduction of point domains.

We've also fixed some tests that were failing because of numeric
imprecision.

Copyright notices on all files updated after NTESS replaced Sandia
Corporation (Lockheed Martin) as the operator of Sandia National Labs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------


VERSION 1.0.2
-------------

-------------------------

NEW FEATURES
------------

* Convex hull measures for 2D spaces (Cartesian and geographic)
* Support Python 3
* Property values can now be null

NOTABLE FIXES
