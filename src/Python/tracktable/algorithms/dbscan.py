    DBSCAN is a clustering algorithm that looks for regions of high
    density in a set of points. Connected regions of high density are
    identified as clusters. Small regions of low density or even
    single points get identified as noise (belonging to no cluster).

    Arguments:
        feature_vectors (list): The points to cluster.
        search_box_half_span (int): The cluster labels with respect to
            two parameters: the search box size (defining "nearby" points)
