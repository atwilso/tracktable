    """Generate points uniformly within a bounding box

    This will generate points according to a uniform random
    distribution within a specified bounding box.

    Note that the uniformity is with respect to each dimension,
    not the underlying metric. You will only get spatially uniform
    points if (1) the bounding box is square and (2) the coordinate
    system is isotropic with respect to the underlying surface.
    Cartesian coordinate systems are such. Geographic coordinates
    (longitude/latitude) are not -- the width of 1 degree of
    longitude changes as a function of latitude.

    Arguments:
        min_corner (Tracktable point type): lower left / SW corner of
           bounding box
        max_corner (Tracktable point type): upper right / NE corner of
           bounding box
