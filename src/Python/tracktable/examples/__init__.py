def copy_example_notebooks(destdir, create_dir=True):
    """Copy Jupyter notebooks to a specified directory

    We bundle several example Jupyter notebooks with Tracktable.
    However, they're installed in a fairly well-hidden directory.
    This function will copy them to someplace more convenient.

    For example:

    .. code-block:: python

       example_path = os.path.expanduser('~/tt_examples')
       os.mkdir(example_path)
       tracktable.examples.copy_example_notebooks(example_path)

    Arguments:
        destdir (string): Destination directory for notebooks

    Keyword Arguments:
        create_directory (boolean): Create directory if it doesn't
            already exist.  Defaults to True.

    Returns:
        No return value.

    Raises:
        OSError: the copy operation failed (probably because the
            destination directory doesn't exist)

    Note:
        This function relies on the ``__file__`` special variable.
        It will probably fail if Tracktable is installed as a zip
        file.
