def convert_to_feature_vector(coords):
    """Package up a list of numbers as a feature vector

    Conceptually, a feature vector is just a list of numbers. However,
    in Tracktable, the functions that work with feature vectors (DBSCAN
    and the R-tree) expect specific data structures in order to go back
    and forth between Python and C++. Specifically, this data structure
    is a tracktable.domain.feature_vectors.POINT_TYPES[NN], where NN is
    the number of values. Right now NN can be no greater than 30.

    The function convert_to_feature_vector() takes a list or tuple of
    numeric values and packages them up in that data structure. It does
    not change or reorder the values in any way.

    Arguments:
        coords (list or tuple of numbers): Sequence of feature values

    Returns:
        Input values bundled up in a FeatureVectorNN data structure as
            described above

    Note:
        In the future, it would be great if the user never had to care
        about this function -- feature vectors would get automatically
        instantiated when the R-tree is built or DBSCAN is invoked.
