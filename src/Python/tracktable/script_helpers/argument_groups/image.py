"""Arguments for image generation.

Use this group as follows::

   from tracktable.script_helpers import argument_groups, argparse
   my_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
   argument_groups.use_group('image', my_parser)

Arguments:

| ``--dpi NUMBER``
| Dots per inch for the image. This determines font height and line width in pixels.
|
| ``--resolution XRES YRES``
| Image resolution. This can be almost arbitrarily large subject to your computer's memory limits.
