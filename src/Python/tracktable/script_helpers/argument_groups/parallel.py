"""Options for parallel movie rendering.

This argument group allows you to set the number of processes and
(eventually) maximum memory that you're willing to use when rendering
movies in parallel.

Arguments:

| ``--processors NUMBER``
|   How many processes to spawn. The default value (0) means 'one process per detected core on the system'.
