"""Customized version of argparse with Response Files

Regular argparse has some support for response files but they're
pretty bare. There's nowhere to put comments, for example. This
subclass enhances that. It adds a few capabilities:

* Argument Groups - Use a group of thematically-related arguments all
  at once instead of having to insert them one by one

* Response Files - Response files can have comments in them. They
  will be automatically parsed from the command line.

* --write-response-file - Like --help, this will write an example
  response file and then exit.
