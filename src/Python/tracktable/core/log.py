def set_log_level(level):

    In Release 1.3, Tracktable uses separate loggers for its
    C++ and Python code. This function will set the log level
    on both of them at once.

    Note:
        There is not yet a way to redirect log messages generated
        in C++ to any sink other than standard error. Expect this
        to be fixed by release 1.4.

    Arguments:
        level (int): desired minimum log level. This will
            usually be one of the constants defined in the `logging`
            module: `NOTSET`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`,
            or `FATAL`. ie, set_log_level(logging.DEBUG)

        No return value.
