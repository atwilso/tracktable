This is a sample standalone C++ project that uses Tracktable as a library.

This mini-project is not part of the tracktable build system. Instead,
it is a template demonstrating how to create your own program using
Tracktable as one of your libraries.

For a quick Linux tutorial you can run:
     sh run-test.sh

This will make a build directory with:
     mkdir build

Change into the build directory:
     cd build

Create the makefiles:
     cmake ..

Build the program:
     make

And run the program:
     ./coolprogram
