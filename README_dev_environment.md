# Setting up a Tracktable development environment

If you're running Anaconda, you can find YML files for development
environments in tracktable/conda_dev_environments/<platform>/*.yml.  

Even if you're not using Anaconda, the contents of these files are a
guide to what you'll need to install in order to build Tracktable
from source.
