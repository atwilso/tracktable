# artifacts (presumably compiled extension modules), and try to
# locate any library dependencies for those artifacts.  
#
# You must have dumpbin.exe on your PATH.  This is packaged with
# Microsoft Visual Studio.  If you use the Developer Tools Command
# Prompt shortcut that Visual Studio puts into the Start menu, you
# will have dumpbin available.
